Problem Description:
You are given a X positive integer. You need to find the N-th root of X.
If the N-th root is in decimal you need to print its floor value e.g, floor(3.23) = 3.

Input format
First line contains T i.e, the number of test cases.
Each test case has a single line that contains two positive integers, X and N.

Output format
For each test case print the floor(N-th root of X) in a new line.

Sample Input 1
4
4 2
9 3
11 2
16 4

Sample Output 1
2
2
3
2

Explanation
For X = 4 and N = 2 => (4) ^ (1/2) = 2. And floor(2) = 2
For X = 9 and N = 3 => (9) ^ (1/3) = 2.08. And floor(2.08) = 2
For X = 11 and N = 2 => (11) ^ (1/2) = 3.316. And floor(3.316) = 3
For X = 16 and N = 4 => (16) ^ (1/4) = 2. And floor(2) = 2

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10 ^ 4
1 <= X <= 10 ^ 9
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 4
