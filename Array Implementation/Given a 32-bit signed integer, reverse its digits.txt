Problem Description:
Given a 32-bit signed integer N, reverse the digits of this integer.

Input format:
Single line containing a 32 bit signed integer N

Output format:
Single line containing a 32 bit signed integer denoting the reverse of N

Sample Input 1
123

Sample Output 1
321

Explanation 1
The digits have been reversed

Sample Input 2
-123

Sample Output 2
-321

Sample Input 3
120

Sample Output 3
21

Constraints
-2^31 <= N <= 2^31-1

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31, 2^31 − 1].
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
