Given an integer A, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to A*A in spiral order. The spiral order will be clockwise in nature starting from (0,0)

Input format:
One line of input, containing a single integer A.

Output format:
Print a 2-d matrix of size A x A satisfying the spiral order.

Sample Input 1
3

Sample Output 1
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5

Explanation:
As you can see the matrix goes spirally with each next position incremented by one.
