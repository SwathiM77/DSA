Problem Description:
Given an integer array, find the largest subarray with sum 0 . If there is more than one subarray with the largest length, return the subarray with the lowest starting index.
If there is no such sub-array print -1.

Input format:
There are 2 lines of input.
First line contains an integer N.
Next line consists of N integers, the values of the array.

Output format:
Print the elements of the sub-array with spaces which have the largest length and sum of elements equal to zero.

Sample Input 1
6
2 3 1 -4 0 6

Sample Output 1
3 1 -4 0

Explanation
The largest subarray with sum zero is (3, 1, -4, 0)

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
