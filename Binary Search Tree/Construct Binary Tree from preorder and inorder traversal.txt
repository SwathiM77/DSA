Problem Description:
Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

Input format
First line contains N, the number of elements in the tree.
Next line contains N space separated integers, denoting preorder.
Next line contains N space separated integers, denoting inorder.

Output format:
Print two lines by traversing the constructed binary tree.
First line should contain N space separated integers, denoting preorder.
Second line should contain N space separated integers, denoting inorder.

Sample Input 1
6
1 2 4 5 3 6
5 4 2 1 3 6

Sample Output 1
1 2 4 5 3 6
5 4 2 1 3 6

Explanation 1
The output writes out the preorder and inorder sequence by traversing the binary tree constructed, so it should be the same as the output.
