Problem Description
Given postorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree and return its root. Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

Input format
First line contains N, number of elements in the tree.
Next line contains N space separated integers, denoting postorder.
Next line contains N space separated integers, denoting inorder.

Output format
Print two lines, first line contains N space separated integers denoting postorder.
Second line contains N space separated integers, denoting inorder.

Note: You just have to return the root of the tree. The input/output is already handled.

Sample Input 1
5
10 4 5 7 8
8 10 4 7 5

Sample Output 1
10 4 5 7 8
8 10 4 7 5

Explanation
The below tree can be formed with the given postorder and inorder Visualization:
        8
            7
          4   5
       10
       
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= Value of node <= 10^9
