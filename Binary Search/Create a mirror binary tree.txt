Problem Description:
Given a binary tree, return the root of the mirror binary tree. Mirror binary tree of a binary tree is a binary tree with left and right children of all nodes interchanged.

    1                 
 3    2
    5   4

Mirror view:
       1
    2     3
 4    5

Input format:

First line contains an integer t - Number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains an integer n - Number of nodes.
Second line of each test case contains n integers - Value of nodes.
Next n lines contain 3 space separated integers i, l, r describing left and right child of ith node as l and r respectively.

Output format:

Print the inorder traversal of the mirror tree in a separate line for each test case.
