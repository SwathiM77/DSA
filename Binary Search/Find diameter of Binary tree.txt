Problem Description:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Input format
First line contains an integer n - Number of nodes.
Second line contains n space separated integers - The value of nodes.
Next n lines contain 3 space separated integers i, l, r describing left and right child of ith node as l and r respectively.

Output format
Print an integer - The length of the diameter.

Sample Input 1
8
10 15 25 12 40 16 8 9
1 5 3
5 6 -1
6 -1 7
7 -1 -1
3 2 4
2 8 -1
8 -1 -1
4 -1 -1

Sample Output 1
6

Explanation
The binary tree is:-
        10
      40   25
    16    15 12
      8   9
      
The path 8->16->40->10->25->15->9 has 6 edges in it and is the longest path in the given tree.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Values of the Nodes <= 10^9
