Problem Description:
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Input format:
Single line containing one 32-bit unsigned integer N.

Output format:
Single line containing number of 1 bits in N.

Sample Input 1
5

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
Binary representation of 5 is:
101
Hence total number of 1 bits = 2

Constraints:
0<=N<=2^32-1
