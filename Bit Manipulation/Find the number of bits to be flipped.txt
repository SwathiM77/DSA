Problem Description:
Given two numbers, write a program to count the number of bits that need to be flipped to convert the first number to the second number.

Input format:
A single line that contains two space separated integers A and B.

Output format:
A single line that contains an integer which represents the number of bits needed to flip to convert integer A to integer B

Constraints:
0 <= A, B <= 10^18

Sample Input 1
29 15

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
Binary of 29 is 11101 and Binary of 15 is 01111. So, 2 bits need to be flipped.

Sample Input 2
7 10

Sample Output 2
3

Explanation 2
Binary of 7 is 00000111 and Binary of 10 is 00001010. So, 3 bits need to be flipped.
