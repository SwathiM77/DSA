Find those two numbers in the most efficient way. Return the two numbers in a sorted manner.

Input format:
First line of input contains N which denotes the number of elements in the input array.
The next line of input contains N space separated integers.

Output format:
Return the two numbers which are present only once in the array in a sorted manner(i.e smaller number first).
