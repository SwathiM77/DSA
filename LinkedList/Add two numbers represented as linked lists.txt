Problem Description:
You’re given two numbers represented by two linked lists, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in forward order i.e the one’s digit is at the tail of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list in the same order.

Input format:
There are 4 lines of input.
First line contains N, the size of the first list
Next line contains N space separated integers
Third line contains M, the size of the second list
Next line contains M space separated integers

Output format:
Return the resultant list after adding given lists.

Function definition:
The given function accepts two arguments - representing the heads of the two lists,and returns the new head.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= M <= 1e5
0 <= value <= 9
