Problem Description:
Given a singly linked list containing N integers, sort it in O(NlogN) time.

Input format:
N - An integer denoting the number of nodes in the linked list.
N integers follow where ith integer denotes the ith node value in the linked list-

Output format:
Return the head of the sorted list.

Function definition:
You have to implement the given function. It accepts the head of the LL as an argument. You have to return the new head of the sorted list after sorting it

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= value <= 10^9
