Problem Description:

Given a binary tree, you have to make sure that there is no node in the tree that has only 1 child. If any node has 1 child then insert its other child with value 0. Return the root and print the inorder of the binary tree thus formed.
Note: The Input/Output is handled for you, the root of the tree is given to you, just modify the tree and return its root.

Input format:
There are n+2 lines of input.
First line contains an integer n - Number of nodes.
Second line contains n space separated integers - The value of nodes.
Next n lines contain 3 space separated integers i, l, r describing left and right child of ith node as l and r respectively.

Output format:
Print the inorder traversal of the tree.

Sample Input 1
5
6 4 3 5 4
1 2 3
2 4 -1
3 -1 5
4 -1 -1
5 -1 -1

Sample Output 1
5 4 0 6 0 3 4

Explanation 1
Tree before insertion:
        6
     4    3
   5        4

Tree after insertion:
         6
     4      3
   5  0   0   4


Constraints:
0 < n < 100000
0 < Value of nodes <= 10000
