Problem Description
Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values.
(i.e. from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate for every level).
For the tree given, zigzag traversal will be:
           1
      2        3
    4   5

1
3 2
4 5

Input format:
Line 1 has the number of test cases (T)
Line 2 to X: First Test Case details with the binary tree structure (refer section below for the format)
Line X+1 to Y: Second Test case details and so on.

Output format:
For each test case, print K lines, where K is the height of the tree. In each line print the values of the zigzag traversed node values.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= Number of nodes in a Tree <= 10000
0 <= Value of each node <= 10^9
It's guaranteed that the sum of the number of tree nodes across all test cases will be less than 500000.
